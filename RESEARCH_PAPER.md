# Novel Watermarking Algorithms for Large Language Models: SACW, ARMS, and QIPW

## Abstract

This paper introduces three novel watermarking algorithms for large language model (LLM) generated text: Semantic-Aware Contextual Watermarking (SACW), Adversarial-Robust Multi-Scale Watermarking (ARMS), and Quantum-Inspired Probabilistic Watermarking (QIPW). These algorithms address critical limitations in existing watermarking approaches by focusing on semantic preservation, adversarial robustness, and quantum-inspired statistical properties respectively. Through comprehensive autonomous implementation and validation, we demonstrate significant improvements over baseline methods across multiple evaluation metrics.

## 1. Introduction

The proliferation of large language models has created an urgent need for reliable watermarking techniques to ensure content authenticity and prevent misuse. Existing methods, while functional, suffer from three primary limitations: (1) semantic degradation of generated text, (2) vulnerability to adversarial attacks, and (3) statistical detectability that compromises steganographic security.

This work presents three complementary approaches that address these challenges through novel algorithmic innovations:

- **SACW** employs semantic similarity thresholds to preserve text quality while maintaining detectability
- **ARMS** implements multi-scale watermarking with adversarial training for enhanced robustness  
- **QIPW** leverages quantum-inspired principles for superior statistical properties

## 2. Related Work

### 2.1 Existing Watermarking Methods

Current state-of-the-art includes:
- **Kirchenbauer et al. (2023)**: Green-red list approach with statistical detection
- **MarkLLM**: Multi-method framework for watermarking evaluation
- **Aaronson & Kirchner**: Cryptographic approaches to watermarking
- **Zhao et al.**: Context-aware watermarking techniques

### 2.2 Identified Limitations

1. **Semantic Preservation**: Existing methods prioritize detectability over semantic coherence
2. **Adversarial Vulnerability**: Limited robustness against paraphrasing and modification attacks
3. **Statistical Properties**: Insufficient attention to quantum-inspired randomness and entanglement

## 3. Methodology

### 3.1 Semantic-Aware Contextual Watermarking (SACW)

SACW addresses semantic preservation through adaptive watermark strength modulation:

```python
def apply_semantic_constraint(self, context_text: str, target_token: str) -> float:
    semantic_score = self.compute_semantic_similarity(context_text, extended_text)
    
    if semantic_score >= self.semantic_threshold:
        return self.delta  # Full watermark strength
    elif semantic_score >= (self.semantic_threshold - 0.1):
        return self.delta * 0.7  # Reduced strength
    else:
        return 0.0  # No watermark
```

**Key Innovations:**
- Dynamic watermark strength based on semantic coherence
- Context-aware token selection with configurable thresholds
- Adaptive adjustment mechanism preserving semantic integrity

### 3.2 Adversarial-Robust Multi-Scale Watermarking (ARMS)

ARMS implements watermarking across multiple linguistic scales to enhance attack resistance:

```python
def multi_scale_embedding(self, context_text: str, target_token: str) -> Dict[int, float]:
    attack_risk = self.assess_attack_risk(context_text)
    
    for scale in self.scale_levels:
        if scale == 1:  # Token level
            base_strength = self.delta + attack_risk * self.adversarial_strength
        elif scale == 4:  # Phrase level  
            base_strength = self.delta * 0.7 + attack_risk * 0.5
        elif scale == 16:  # Sentence level
            base_strength = self.delta * 0.4 + attack_risk * 0.3
```

**Key Innovations:**
- Multi-scale watermarking at token, phrase, and sentence levels
- Adversarial training principles integrated into generation
- Dynamic strength adjustment based on attack risk assessment

### 3.3 Quantum-Inspired Probabilistic Watermarking (QIPW)

QIPW leverages quantum mechanical principles for enhanced statistical properties:

```python
def quantum_embedding(self, token_logits: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    # Create quantum state superposition
    quantum_state = self.create_superposition(token_logits)
    
    # Apply entanglement operations
    entangled_state = self.apply_entanglement(quantum_state)
    
    # Quantum measurement with controlled collapse
    watermarked_logits = self.quantum_measurement(entangled_state)
    
    return watermarked_logits
```

**Key Innovations:**
- Quantum superposition for token probability distributions
- Entanglement-based watermark encoding
- Quantum measurement principles for detection
