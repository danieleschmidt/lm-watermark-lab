# 🚀 LM Watermark Lab - SDLC Setup Instructions

## 🎯 What Has Been Implemented

This repository now includes a **comprehensive, enterprise-grade SDLC automation framework** with:

✅ **Complete CI/CD Pipeline** (5 workflow files)  
✅ **Production-Ready Infrastructure** (Docker, monitoring, security)  
✅ **Developer Experience** (devcontainer, pre-commit, documentation)  
✅ **Automated Quality Gates** (testing, security, performance)  
✅ **Operational Excellence** (monitoring, alerting, maintenance)  

## 🔧 Quick Setup (2 Minutes)

### Step 1: Activate the CI/CD Workflows

The GitHub Actions workflows are ready to deploy but need to be manually activated due to permission restrictions:

```bash
# Run the automated setup script
./scripts/setup_workflows.sh

# This will:
# ✅ Copy all workflow files to .github/workflows/
# ✅ Validate YAML syntax
# ✅ Provide setup guidance and next steps
```

### Step 2: Commit and Push the Workflows

```bash
# Add the workflow files
git add .github/workflows/

# Use the provided commit message
git commit -F .github/workflows/COMMIT_MESSAGE.txt

# Push to activate the workflows
git push
```

### Step 3: Configure Repository Settings

1. **Enable Actions** (if not already enabled)
2. **Configure Secrets** (optional, for enhanced features):
   - `PYPI_API_TOKEN` - For package publishing
   - `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` - For notifications
3. **Set Branch Protection Rules** for `main` branch
