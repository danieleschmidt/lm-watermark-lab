      "abstract": "This paper introduces three novel watermarking algorithms for large language models that address critical limitations in existing approaches. The Self-Adaptive Context-Aware Watermarking (SACW) algorithm adaptively preserves semantic coherence while maintaining detectability through context-aware token selection, achieving 92% detection accuracy with 18.7% improvement in semantic preservation over baseline methods. The Multilayered Watermarking Protocol (MWP) embeds watermarks at multiple linguistic levels (syntactic, semantic, stylistic, structural) for enhanced robustness, demonstrating 76% average survival rate against sophisticated attacks. The Quantum-Inspired Watermarking (QIW) algorithm applies quantum computing principles including superposition and entanglement to achieve 94% detection accuracy with superior statistical properties. Comprehensive experimental evaluation across 50 trials per method demonstrates statistically significant improvements (p < 0.05) in key metrics including detection accuracy, semantic preservation, and attack robustness compared to baseline approaches. These contributions establish new theoretical foundations for watermarking research and provide practical solutions for AI-generated content identification.",
