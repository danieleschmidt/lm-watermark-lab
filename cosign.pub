# This file would contain the public key for Cosign container signing
# Repository maintainers should generate a proper key pair for production use:
# cosign generate-key-pair

# For development and CI setup, see:
# - https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign/overview/
# - docs/SECURITY.md for signing setup instructions

# Example public key format (replace with actual key):
# -----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
# [Base64 encoded public key content]
# -----END PUBLIC KEY-----

# DO NOT commit private keys to the repository
# Store cosign.key securely in GitHub Secrets or similar
