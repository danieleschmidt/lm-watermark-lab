### 10. Post-Release Tasks

- [ ] Update project documentation links
- [ ] Announce release on community channels
- [ ] Update dependent projects/examples
- [ ] Monitor for issues in first 24 hours
- [ ] Create milestone for next release

## Hotfix Process

For critical bugs requiring immediate release:

### 1. Create Hotfix Branch

```bash
# Branch from main (or release tag)
git checkout main
git checkout -b hotfix/v1.2.1

# Make minimal fix
# Update version to 1.2.1
# Update CHANGELOG.md
```

### 2. Fast-Track Release

```bash
# Abbreviated testing
pytest tests/unit/ tests/integration/
python -m build
twine check dist/*

# Create PR with "hotfix" label
gh pr create --title "Hotfix v1.2.1" --label "hotfix"

# After approval and merge
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git tag -a v1.2.1 -m "Hotfix v1.2.1 - Critical bug fixes"
git push origin v1.2.1

# Release to PyPI
python -m build
twine upload dist/*
```

## Release Automation

### GitHub Actions Integration

Our CI/CD pipeline automates several release steps:

1. **On PR to main**: Run full test suite, security scans
2. **On tag creation**: Build and publish to PyPI, create GitHub release
3. **On release**: Update Docker images, notify team

### Release Scripts

Use the provided release scripts for consistency:

```bash
# Prepare release
scripts/prepare-release.sh 1.2.0

# Publish release (after manual approval)
scripts/publish-release.sh 1.2.0
```

## Version Management

### Pre-release Versions

For testing and development:

```bash
# Alpha release
1.2.0a1, 1.2.0a2, ...

# Beta release  
1.2.0b1, 1.2.0b2, ...

# Release candidate
1.2.0rc1, 1.2.0rc2, ...
```

### Development Versions

Between releases, use development versions:

```bash
# After 1.2.0 release, next dev version
1.3.0.dev0
```

## Rollback Procedure

If a release has critical issues:

### 1. Immediate Response
- [ ] Document the issue
- [ ] Assess impact and affected users
- [ ] Decide on rollback vs. hotfix

### 2. PyPI Rollback
```bash
# Remove problematic version (use sparingly)
# Contact PyPI support if needed

# Or release new version with fixes
```

### 3. Communication
- [ ] Update GitHub release with warning
- [ ] Notify users via GitHub discussions
- [ ] Update documentation

## Release Metrics

Track these metrics for each release:

- **Development time**: From start to release
- **Bug count**: Issues found post-release
- **Adoption rate**: Download statistics
- **User feedback**: GitHub issues, discussions

## Emergency Contact

For release-related emergencies:
- **Release Manager**: @terragon-labs/maintainers
- **Security Issues**: security@terragonlabs.com
- **Infrastructure**: @terragon-labs/devops-team
